Blazor is an alternative to Javascript frameworks like Angular, React or Vue.js - but instead of using Javascript for your UI it uses C#.

This blog is build using Client-side Blazor which is an amazing implementation of a new feature of moderns browsers - WebAssembly. It allows browsers to run compiled code in the browser (with some limitations, of course, - to make sure that the website is not trying to format your hard drive).
